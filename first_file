This is my first file.
The time is 2016-4-2.
Tomorrow is the day the Spring quarter begins. I feel upset. I'm not ready at all.
And I'm also upset because I find git difficult.
I hope it won't be difficult in the future, maybe when the next time I open this file.
Bye!
:)

It's not working.
So angry.


Another try. Yew, another.

Yes. Lines I added to the file in the test branch are not here.
This is how branching works I guess.
