This is my first file.
The time is 2016-4-2.
Tomorrow is the day the Spring quarter begins. I feel upset. I'm not ready at all.
And I'm also upset because I find git difficult.
I hope it won't be difficult in the future, maybe when the next time I open this file.
Bye!
:)

It's not working.
So angry.


Another try. Yew, another.


This is me learning branching.
This is in the brach_test branch.
Yes, I misspelled the word "branch".
I hope I can learn to change names of branch in the future.
